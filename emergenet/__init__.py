Emergenet: Fast Scalable Emergence Risk Assessment of Influenza A Strains Circulating In Non-human Hosts

Emergenet is a general tool to infer digital twins of the wild viral evolutionary dynamics for the fast and scalable assessment of the emergence risk. The current implementation targets  Influenza A strains circulating in non-human hosts, to predict emergence risk. 

 Description:                                                                    
    Uncovering rules of organization, competition, succession and exploitation

Emergenet: Fast Scalable Emergence Risk Assessment of Influenza A Strains Circulating In Non-human Hosts

Emergenet is a general tool to infer digital twins of the wild viral evolutionary dynamics. The current implementation targets  Influenza A strains circulating in non-human hosts to ranl-order strains according to their risk of emergence.

The underlying theory is based on uncovering an intrinsic distancebetween viral strains that scales with the probability of spontaneous jump  in the wild.

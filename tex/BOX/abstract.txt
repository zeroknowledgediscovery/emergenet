Emergenet: Fast Scalable Pandemic Risk Assessment of
Influenza A Strains Circulating In Non-human Hosts

Animal influenza viruses emerging into humans have triggered devastating pandemics in the past. Yet, our ability to evaluate the pandemic potential of individual strains that do not yet circulate in humans, remains limited. In this study we introduce the Emergenet, to computationally learn how new variants emerge, shaped by evolutionary constraints using only observed genomic sequences of key viral proteins. Analyzing Haemagglutinnin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) sequences from > 98,000 sequenced strains, we estimate the likelihood of specific future mutations, and the numerical odds of specific descendants arising via natural processes. After validating our model to forecast the dominant strain(s) for
seasonal flu, with Emergenet-based forecasts significantly outperforming WHO recommendations almost consistently over the past two decades for H1N1/H3N2 subtypes, individually in the Northern/Southern hemispheres (average match-improvement 32.25% over two decades, 69.07% over the last decade, and 81.13% over the pre-COVID-19 five year period for H1N1 HA), we assess the pandemic potential of animal strains not yet known to transmit in humans. While the state-of-the-art Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) from the CDC to assess such risk includes time-consuming experimental assays, our calculations take  6s=strain, yet strongly correlating with published IRAT scores (correlation: 0.703, p-value: 0.00026). This six orders of magnitude speedup is necessary to exploit current surveillance capacity via scalably analyzing thousands of strains collected annually. Considering 6,066 wild Influenza A viruses sequenced post-2020, we identify risky strains of diverse subtypes, hosts and geo-locations, with six having esti-
mated emergence scores >6.5. Such scalable risk-ranking can enable preemptive pandemic mitigation, including the targeted inoculation of animal hosts before the first human infection, and outline new public health measures that are potentially effective notwithstanding possible vaccine hesitancy in humans.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a unique clinical entity
that juxtaposes the health interests of mothers, babies, and
communities. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) de-
fines gestational diabetes as diabetes first diagnosed in the
second or first trimester of pregnancy that is not clearly pre-existing  type 1 or 2 diabetes [1••]. With dramatic increases in
type 2 diabetes and obesity, identification of women with pre-
existing type 2 diabetes by first trimester screening is impor-
tant. In the second trimester of pregnancy, screening for GDM
should be completed for all women. The foundation of GDM
treatment is lifestyle interventions; medications, primarily in-
sulin, are indicated if lifestyle measures are insufficient.

Treatment of GDM reduces risk of pregnancy complications
and adverse neonatal outcomes including macrosomia and
shoulder dystocia [2]. After pregnancy, maternal risk for
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease is increased
and continued follow-up and early intervention for im-
paired glucose intolerance are crucial.

Prevalence

In 2017, it was estimated that 21.3 million births (16.2%)
worldwide were affected by hyperglycemia in pregnancy,
and of these, 86.4% were due to GDM. There is a notable
regional variation with age-adjusted prevalence ranging from
9.5% in Africa to 26.6% in Southeast Asia [4]. In the USA,
according to 2016 data from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), the crude national prevalence of GDM
was 6.0% and pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy was 0.9%.

From 2012 to 2016, standardized prevalence increased for
gestational diabetes (5.2 to 5.6%) and was stable for pre-
existing diabetes (0.8%). Accounting for race/ethnicity, the
prevalence of GDM was highest among non-Hispanic Asian
women (11.1%).

Risk Modifiers

Accounting for BMI, prevalence of gestational diabetes ranged from 3.6% for normal-weight women (pre-pregnancy BMI 18.5–24.9) to 13.9% with class III obesity (BMI ≥ 40.0) [5•]. 

GDM prevalence also increases with
advancing maternal age. A retrospective cohort including over
1.7 million births in women aged 40–54 between 1998 and
2014 showed that gestational diabetes increased in all racial/
ethnic groups throughout the study period with the largest
increases in Asian or Pacific Islander (from 13.7 to 22.4%)
and Hispanic women (11.2 to 19.3%) [6].

Causal Indicators

Studies continue to identify candidate
genes for GDM including a recent finding that PAX8, a gene
important in thyroid development and function, may play a
role in islet survival during the stress of pregnancy [11].

The available data suggests that type 2 diabetes suscepti-
bility genes are also linked to GDM including variants in
TCF7L2, MTNR1B, KCNJ11, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, GCK,
and KCNQ1 [10].

Pre-pregnancy indicators

Recent research has examined the use of pre-pregnancy biomarkers to identify women at high risk for gestational diabetes. A case control study of 256 GDM cases found that sex hormone binding globulin, glucose, adiponectin, and homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were independently associated with odds for GDM.

Using these biomarkers, a risk score was composed which showed a
better predictive value for GDM than traditional risk factors of
age, ethnicity, BMI, family history of DM, and personal his-
tory of GDM (AUC 0.74 versus 0.67)

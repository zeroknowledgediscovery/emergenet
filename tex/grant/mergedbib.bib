  abstract	= "{The definition and nature of autism have been highly
		  debated, as exemplified by several revisions of the DSM
		  (DSM-III, DSM-IIIR, DSM-IV, and DSM-5) criteria. There has
		  recently been a move from a categorical view toward a
		  spectrum-based view. These changes have been accompanied by
		  a steady increase in the prevalence of the condition.
		  Changes in the definition of autism that may increase
		  heterogeneity could affect the results of autism research;
		  specifically, a broadening of the population with autism
		  could result in decreasing effect sizes of group comparison
		  studies.To examine the correlation between publication year
		  and effect size of autism-control group comparisons across
		  several domains of published autism neurocognitive
		  research.This meta-analysis investigated 11 meta-analyses
		  obtained through a systematic search of PubMed for
		  meta-analyses published from January 1, 1966, through
		  January 27, 2019, using the search string autism AND
		  (meta-analysis OR meta-analytic). The last search was
		  conducted on January 27, 2019.Meta-analyses were included
		  if they tested the significance of group differences
		  between individuals with autism and control individuals on
		  a neurocognitive construct. Meta-analyses were only
		  included if the tested group difference was significant and
		  included data with a span of at least 15 years.Data were
		  extracted and analyzed according to the Preferred Reporting
		  Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)
		  reporting guideline using fixed-effects models.Estimated
		  slope of the correlation between publication year and
		  effect size, controlling for differences in methods, sample
		  size, and study quality.The 11 meta-analyses included data
		  from a total of 27 723 individuals. Demographic data such
		  as sex and age were not available for the entire data set.
		  Seven different psychological and neurologic constructs
		  were analyzed based on data from these meta-analyses.
		  Downward temporal trends for effect size were found for all
		  constructs (slopes: –0.067 to –0.003), with the trend
		  being significant in 5 of 7 cases: emotion recognition
		  (slope: –0.028 [95\% CI, –0.048 to –0.007]), theory
		  of mind (–0.045 [95\% CI, –0.066 to –0.024]),
		  planning (–0.067 [95\% CI, –0.125 to –0.009]), P3b
		  amplitude (–0.048 [95\% CI, –0.093 to –0.004]), and
		  brain size (–0.047 [95\% CI, –0.077 to –0.016]). In
		  contrast, 3 analogous constructs in schizophrenia, a
		  condition that is also heterogeneous but with no reported
		  increase in prevalence, did not show a similar trend.The
		  findings suggest that differences between individuals with
		  autism and those without the diagnosis have decreased over
		  time and that possible changes in the definition of autism
		  from a narrowly defined and homogenous population toward an
		  inclusive and heterogeneous population may reduce our
		  capacity to build mechanistic models of the condition.}",

  abstract	= {When I first started studying epidemiology, ecological
		  studies were briefly discussed as an inexpensive but
		  unreliable method for studying individual level risk
		  factors for disease. For example, rather than go to the
		  time and expense to establish a cohort study or
		  case-control study of fat intake and breast cancer, you
		  could simply use national dietary and cancer incidence data
		  and, with minimal time and expense, show a strong
		  correlation internationally between fat intake and breast
		  cancer. This approach was quite rightly regarded as
		  inadequate and unreliable because of the many additional
		  forms of bias that can occur in such studies compared with
		  studies of individuals within a population. In particular,
		  the “ecological fallacy” can occur in that factors that
		  are associated with national disease rates may not be
		  associated with disease in individuals.1 For example,
		  almost any disease that is associated with affluence and
		  Westernisation has in the past been associated at the
		  national level with sales of television sets, and nowadays
		  is probably associated at the national level with rates of
		  internet use.
		  
		  Thus, ecological studies were not a good thing to do, and
		  were a relic of the “pre-modern” phase of epidemiology
		  before it became firmly established with a methodologic
		  paradigm based on the theory of randomised controlled
		  trials of individuals. This paradigm, which is very
		  powerful when used appropriately, gave rise to increasingly
		  sophisticated methods of study design and data analysis. In
		  particular, biostatistical methods that were developed for
		  randomised trials involving a single individual level
		  exposure were used to reformulate and make more rigorous
		  the previously ad hoc epidemiological methods of study

		  providers in the community. Staff completing record review
		  and abstraction receive extensive training and supervision
		  and are evaluated according to strict reliability standards
		  to certify effective initial training, identify ongoing
		  training needs, and ensure adherence to the prescribed
		  methodology. Record review and abstraction occurs in a
		  variety of data sources ranging from general pediatric
		  health clinics to specialized programs serving children
		  with developmental disabilities. In addition, most of the
		  ADDM sites also review records for children who have
		  received special education services in public schools. In
		  the second phase of the study, all abstracted information
		  is reviewed systematically by experienced clinicians to
		  determine ASD case status. A child is considered to meet
		  the surveillance case definition for ASD if he or she
		  displays behaviors, as described on one or more
		  comprehensive evaluations completed by community-based
		  professional providers, consistent with the Diagnostic and
		  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition,
		  Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria for autistic
		  disorder; pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise
		  specified (PDD-NOS, including atypical autism); or Asperger
		  disorder. This report provides updated ASD prevalence
		  estimates for children aged 8 years during the 2014
		  surveillance year, on the basis of DSM-IV-TR criteria, and
		  describes characteristics of the population of children
		  with ASD. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association
		  published the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
		  Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which made considerable
		  changes to ASD diagnostic criteria. The change in ASD
		  diagnostic criteria might influence ADDM ASD prevalence
		  estimates; therefore, most (85\%) of the records used to
		  determine prevalence estimates based on DSM-IV-TR criteria
		  underwent additional review under a newly operationalized
		  surveillance case definition for ASD consistent with the
		  DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Children meeting this new
		  surveillance case definition could qualify on the basis of
		  one or both of the following criteria, as documented in
		  abstracted comprehensive evaluations: 1) behaviors
		  consistent with the DSM-5 diagnostic features; and/or 2) an
		  ASD diagnosis, whether based on DSM-IV-TR or DSM-5
		  diagnostic criteria. Stratified comparisons of the number
		  of children meeting either of these two case definitions
		  also are reported.\\ For 2014, the overall prevalence of
		  ASD among the 11 ADDM sites was 16.8 per 1,000 (one in 59)
		  children aged 8 years. Overall ASD prevalence estimates
		  varied among sites, from 13.1-29.3 per 1,000 children aged
		  8 years. ASD prevalence estimates also varied by sex and
		  race/ethnicity. Males were four times more likely than
		  females to be identified with ASD. Prevalence estimates
		  were higher for non-Hispanic white (henceforth, white)
		  children compared with non-Hispanic black (henceforth,
		  black) children, and both groups were more likely to be
		  identified with ASD compared with Hispanic children. Among
		  the nine sites with sufficient data on intellectual
		  ability, 31\% of children with ASD were classified in the
		  range of intellectual disability (intelligence quotient
		  [IQ] <70), 25\% were in the borderline range (IQ 71-85),
		  and 44\% had IQ scores in the average to above average
		  range (i.e., IQ >85). The distribution of intellectual
		  ability varied by sex and race/ethnicity. Although mention
		  of developmental concerns by age 36 months was documented
		  for 85\% of children with ASD, only 42\% had a
		  comprehensive evaluation on record by age 36 months. The
		  median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis was 52 months
		  and did not differ significantly by sex or race/ethnicity.
		  For the targeted comparison of DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 results,
		  the number and characteristics of children meeting the
		  newly operationalized DSM-5 case definition for ASD were
		  similar to those meeting the DSM-IV-TR case definition,
		  with DSM-IV-TR case counts exceeding DSM-5 counts by less
		  than 5\% and approximately 86\% overlap between the two
		  case definitions (kappa = 0.85).\\ Findings from the ADDM
		  Network, on the basis of 2014 data reported from 11 sites,
		  provide updated population-based estimates of the
		  prevalence of ASD among children aged 8 years in multiple
		  communities in the United States. The overall ASD
		  prevalence estimate of 16.8 per 1,000 children aged 8 years
		  in 2014 is higher than previously reported estimates from
		  the ADDM Network. Because the ADDM sites do not provide a
		  representative sample of the entire United States, the
		  combined prevalence estimates presented in this report
		  cannot be generalized to all children aged 8 years in the
		  United States. Consistent with reports from previous ADDM
		  surveillance years, findings from 2014 were marked by
		  variation in ASD prevalence when stratified by geographic
		  area, sex, and level of intellectual ability. Differences
		  in prevalence estimates between black and white children
		  have diminished in most sites, but remained notable for
		  Hispanic children. For 2014, results from application of
		  the DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 case definitions were similar,
		  overall and when stratified by sex, race/ethnicity,
		  DSM-IV-TR diagnostic subtype, or level of intellectual
		  ability.\\ Beginning with surveillance year 2016, the DSM-5
		  case definition will serve as the basis for ADDM estimates
		  of ASD prevalence in future surveillance reports. Although
		  the DSM-IV-TR case definition will eventually be phased
		  out, it will be applied in a limited geographic area to
		  offer additional data for comparison. Future analyses will
		  examine trends in the continued use of DSM-IV-TR diagnoses,
		  such as autistic disorder, PDD-NOS, and Asperger disorder
		  in health and education records, documentation of symptoms
		  consistent with DSM-5 terminology, and how these trends
		  might influence estimates of ASD prevalence over time. The
		  latest findings from the ADDM Network provide evidence that
		  the prevalence of ASD is higher than previously reported
		  estimates and continues to vary among certain racial/ethnic
		  groups and communities. With prevalence of ASD ranging from
		  13.1 to 29.3 per 1,000 children aged 8 years in different
		  communities throughout the United States, the need for
		  behavioral, educational, residential, and occupational
		  services remains high, as does the need for increased
		  research on both genetic and nongenetic risk factors for ASD.}

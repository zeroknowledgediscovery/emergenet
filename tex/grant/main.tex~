\lfoot{\thepage \\ Project Summary}
% Despite increasing prevalence, the
While detailed etiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is  unclear~\citep{hyman2020identification},  a combination of genetic and environmental factors including xenobiotic exposure  during early 
neurodevelopment are implicated as important risk factors in ASD pathogenesis~\citep{bolte2019contribution,santos2022role}. In this pilot, we plan to validate our preliminary results that suggest that there might exist pharmacological interventions that are protective against ASD disease onset,  and may clarify ASD pathobiology of a subset of non-syndromic cases, namely children whose biological mothers were prescribed specific anti-depressants during pregnancy.

\textbf{Hypotheses:} This pilot is centered around  the  hypotheses: 1) Anomalous induction of cytochrome P450 enzyme 2D6 in the fetal brain during early development increases the risk of disease onset, and  2) Pre and post-natal pharmacological  mechanism-based-inhibition (MBI) of CYP2D6, especially via off-target effect of the SSRI paroxetine,   can significantly and substantially reduce risk.% , and 3)  up-regulating Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) during pregnancy ($e.g.$ by taking SSRI sertraline) significantly increase risk.
Importantly, these hypotheses do not replace the complex genetic burden  implicated in autism etiology, but suggests that specific modes of the xenobiotic response  pathways  might have an important but hitherto under-appreciated role in disease onset, and selective and timely down-regulation of these responses may reduce the onset risk. Importantly, we are aiming to generate evidence in support of pharmacologically actionable protective effect against some mechanisms of ASD pathogenesis.

\textbf{Overall Rationale:} Environmental triggers can induce  xenobiotic response via the P450 pathways. It is known that some xenobiotic stimuli  reach the fetus, which can then induce 2D6 activation. Anomalous activation of the 2D6 enzyme may interfere with  brain development, perhaps via impacting the developing glial system~\citep{gzielo2021astroglia,kuban2021cytochrome}. Pharmacological inhibition of the 2D6 pathway reduces the odds of such  activation, thereby reducing the population risk for autism. Certain drug(s) for which we find a population-level protective effect in our preliminary studies $e.g.$ paroxetine~\citep{brosen1998differences},  are known to cross the placenta~\citep{brosen1998differences} and have the desired off-target 2D6 inhibition. Such inhibition induced   during pregnancy can promote normal fetal development.

\textbf{Preliminary Data:} Using IBM Marketscan administrative database, we associated the history of medical encounters of pregnant women with the eventual ASD status of their children ($n=184,438$), and found significant and substantial protective  signals for specific drugs, that merit detailed investigation.

\textbf{Impact on Autism research:} If validated, our results will clarify aspects of ASD pathogenesis, and potentially enable  interventions that reduce  risk of disease onset immediately in the sub-population  who are prescribed anti-depressants during pregnancy, and more broadly might chart a path towards targeted drug development for reducing  risk in the general population of pregnant women.

\textbf{Research Aims:} The research aims of the project are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  %

\item \textit{Retrospective EHR analysis of new datasets} to  strengthen our population-level results associating during-pregnancy anti-depressant prescriptions to ASD outcomes. Datasets will include patient cohorts from Univesity of Chicago (UoC), consisting of drugs taken by all pregnant women treated in the University of Chicago Medical Center between 2006 and 2024 (n$\approx$ 45,000), their psychiatric and other diagnoses, their demographic, racial and ethnic backgrounds, and the eventual ASD status of their children. 
  % 

\item \textit{Genomic analysis using biosamples from proband and matched designated sibling procured from  Simon Simplex Collection.}  We will investigate if genetically determined CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype differs in discordant SSC sibling pairs in alignment wiht our hypotheses.
 The complexity of identifying polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 gene~\citep{lanillos2022clinical,yang2017sequencing}
  will require re-sequencing the biosamples, and the SSC availability of matched sibling controls will definitively resolve if our hypothesis is correct.
 \end{enumerate}

The pilot project will last 24 months, and cost \$300K, and will be carried out  at the  University of Chicago.

\section*{Proposal Narrative}
%
\subsection*{Scientific Background} While the neurobiological basis of autism remains poorly understood~\citep{hyman2020identification},  children with autism experience higher-than-expected rates of many diseases, including conditions   implicating immune dysregulation and microglial activation~\citep{pmid15546155,pmid21595886,pmid21629840,pmid26793298,pmid30483058,pmid29691724} during important brain developmental periods  of  myelination and synaptogenesis~\citep{pmid30733689,pmid22511918,pmid25681541}. These studies, along with support from large-scale exome sequencing~\citep{pmid25038753}, have linked the disorder to putative mechanisms of  chronic neuroinflammation during important brain developmental periods  of  myelination and synaptogenesis. % However, the co-morbid conditions are common in control populations, and 
% ASD genes exhibit extensive phenotypic variability, with identical variants associated with diverse individual outcomes not limited to ASD~\citep{pmid23537858}. Additionally, no single
% gene can be considered ``causal'' for more than 1\% of cases of idiopathic autism~\citep{pmid23637569}.
%
Currently, while over one hundred to 1000 genes have been shown to contribute to autism risk~\citep{pmid26402605,pmid25038753,pmid27891212}, genetic  mechanisms  account for a limited number of ASD cases~\citep{pmid18414403}, suggesting a role for  environmental triggers. The plausible sources of  risk are estimated to range from prenatal  factors such as maternal infection and inflammation, diet, and  household chemical exposures,  to autoimmune conditions and localized inflammation of the central nervous system after birth~\citep{pmid30971960,pmid30941018,pmid29691724,pmid29307081,pmid27351598,pmid26793298,pmid30095240,pmid25681541}. The heterogeneity of ASD presentation  admits the possibility of a plurality of   etiologies with converging pathophysiological pathways, making the investigation of future risk modulation challenging.

In this pilot we propose to validate one aspect of the pathogenesis that might explain disease onset for a specific subpopulation of the idiopathic cases, namely children with mothers taking  anti-depressants during pregnancy. Our preliminary results indicate that  at least one common anti-depressant (paroxetine) has a significant and substantial protective effect against the disease onset, verified retrospectively in a relatively large national  population ($n$=186K).  Our results suggest that
perhaps hyper/anomalous induction of xenobiotic response pathways, particularly via the CYP2D6 gene encoding the 2D6 enzyme of the P450 family, might be implicated in some non-syndromic cases, and pharmacological inhibition of  CYP2D6  in the  fetus might confer a protective effect. In this pilot study, we aim to gather further evidence in support of these hypotheses.

The potential role of environmental toxins, commonly present in everyday household and industrial products and food, in ASD pathogenesis is now well-recognized~\citep{santos2022role}. Crucial in regulating the harmful effects of these xenobiotics to the developing fetus are physiological detoxification
pathways, that involve series of enzymatic reactions that act to eliminate toxins, or their metabolites from cells. These are mediated by large families of molecules, including cytochromes P450 (CYPs). Most of these enzymes are encoded by highly polymorphic genes, with variants affecting the metabolizer status of their carriers~\citep{santos2018novel}.  Although CYP2D6 constitutes a relatively small fraction of the total  P450 content~\citep{shimada1994interindividual}, the contribution of this isoform is significant due to its role in the metabolism and clearance of many therapeutic agents that target the cardiovascular and central nervous system, and over 100 polymorphisms are known.

Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat a variety of mental disorders, including depression, and anxiety,  and is both a substrate for and an inhibitor of CYP2D6~\citep{greenblatt1999human,bertelsen2003apparent}. Metabolized by CYP2D6 via demethylenation of the methylenedioxy group, yielding a catechol metabolite and formic acid~\citep{bloomer1992role}, paroxetine inhibits CYP2D6 activity at $IC_{50}$ concentrations ranging from $150 nM - 2.0 \mu M$, depending on the substrate~\citep{bertelsen2003apparent}. 
%
\subsection*{Preliminary results}
In our preliminary analysis, using the IBM Marketscan administrative database, we associated the history of medical encounters of pregnant women with the eventual ASD status of their children ($n=184,438$), and found significant and substantial protective as well as risk-increasing signals for specific drugs, that merit detailed investigation. Demographic information was not available for Marketscan samples.

We found that women who were prescribed paroxetine during pregnancy have a significantly lower risk (risk ratio=0.743, [0.576, 0.981] at 95\% confidence) of their children eventually being diagnosed with autism (Table~\ref{tabprelim}). The effect is more pronounced when the first prescription is recorded during the second trimester (risk ratio: 0.284, [0.091, 0.954] at 95\% confidence). The timing might be important as the second trimester has been shown in some studies~\citep{rezaie2003distribution,li2021prenatal}, to be when differentiated astrocytes begin to develop in the fetal brain. The significant protective effect from paroxetine is observed (Table~\ref{tabprelim})  if we compare against either women who had no  psychotropic prescriptions recorded in the database, or those who had at least one recorded prescription of antidepressants or were diagnosed with a depressive disorder during or before the pregnancy (risk ratio: 0.687 [0.524,0.900] at 95\% confidence). Also no such associative effect is observed for either cerebral palsy or intellectual disability if diagnosed in the children. These results, combined with known/suspected mechanistic insights (see below), provides prima facie  support for our hypotheses.

To reach the stated hypotheses, we noted that
existing evidence from published studies suggest:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Paroxetine  strongly inhibits CYP2D6~\citep{brosen1998differences}. While other SSRI such as fluoxetine and bupropion also inhibit CYP2D6, paroxetine uniquely carries out a mechanism-based inhibition (MBI) of CYP2D6~\citep{bertelsen2003apparent} as opposed to  competitive inhibition  by fluoxetine, quinidine, and bupropion~\citep{kim2008effects,deodhar2021assessing}. MBIs require enzymatic activation by the target protein prior to exerting inhibitory
effect, and forms the metabolite intermediate complex
(MIC). The MIC can then exert its inhibitory effect by 1) forming a
direct covalent interaction, 2) forming a noncovalent tight binding
complex, or 3) forming an inactive enzyme product that is released
from the inhibitor. In particular, MBIs can lower final concentration of the enzymatically catalyzed product.
%
\item Astroglial cells in the brain are implicated in autism~\citep{gzielo2021astroglia}
\item CYP2D6  is functional in human brain in-vivo~\citep{tolledo2020human}, and is known to express in glial cells in the brain~\citep{kuban2021cytochrome},  and has been found in neurons in numerous human brain areas~\citep{ingelman2014polymorphic}. Additionally, associations between CYP2D6 genotypes and personality traits are known, with rapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 at elevated suicide risk.
\item Induction of CYP2D6 elevated in pregnancy~\citep{wadelius1997induction}, and paroxetine is known to pass from the pregnant mother to the fetus~\citep{koren2018clinical}.
\item Differences in CYP2D6 genotype may have divergent effects on maternal plasma paroxetine concentrations during pregnancy, with therapeutic consequences~\citep{ververs2009effect}.
\item CYP2D6 is  implicated in ASD pathogenesis~\citep{santos2022role}
  \end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Possible mechanistic intuition for autism pathobiology in some non-syndromic cases}
Environmental triggers can induce a xenobiotic response which activates P450 pathways. It is known that some xenobiotic stimuli can reach the fetus, which can then induce 2D6 activation. A hyper or anomalous activation of the 2D6 enzyme may interfere with fetal brain development, perhaps via impacting the typical trajectory of the developing glial system. Pharmacological inhibition of the 2D6 pathway reduces the odds of such anomalous activation and its downstream event sequence, thereby reducing the population risk for autism. Since the drug(s) in question are known to cross the placenta and reach the fetus, such inhibition may be induced when the mother is exposed to them during pregnancy, and help maintain normal fetal development (Fig.~\ref{figscheme}).
%
\subsection*{Explaining Autism Prevalence Dependence on Demography and Sex} Our hypothesis, if true, would manifest verifiable population-level patterns, $e.g.$,  dependence of  ASD prevalence on sex and demography:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Males have a lower typical baseline expression of CYP2D6~\citep{gleiter1996gender}. This might explain why autism is more prevalent in males, since anomalous hyper-induction will have a relatively greater impact.
\item Populations with more reduced-functional CYP2D6 polymorphisms~\citep{gaedigk2002unique} have smaller ASD prevalence (Asians, Africans) relative to general population (Table~\ref{tabdem}). Thus,  CYP2D6 polymorphism distribution might contribute, alongside socio-cultural and   diagnostic biases, in lowering ASD prevalence in  Africans and Asians.
\end{enumerate}
%
\subsection*{Specific aims}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Retrospective EHR analysis of new datasets} to  strengthen our population-level results associating during-pregnancy prescriptions to ASD outcomes. Datasets will include patient cohorts from University of Chicago Medical Center (UCM), consisting of  pregnant women treated in the University of Chicago Medical Center between 2006 and 2024 ($n \approx 45,000$), their psychiatric and other diagnosis, prescriptions, their demographic, racial and ethnic backgrounds, and  eventual ASD status of their children. 
  % 
\item \textit{Genomic analysis using biosamples from proband and matched designated sibling procured from  Simon Simplex Collection}  We will investigate if there is an increase in the frequency of CYP2D6 poor metabolizers in designated unaffected siblings of probands with ASD. The complexity of identifying CYP2D6 phenotype~\citep{lanillos2022clinical,yang2017sequencing} will require specific CYP2D6 genotyping, including copy number determination, of the biosamples.
%
%We will investigate if reduced and non-functional polymorphisms of CYP2D6 and other key genes  in case/control cohorts  align with our hypotheses. The complexity of the CYP2D6 gene will require re-sequencing the biosamples.%, and the SSC availability of matched sibling controls will definitively answer this question.
\end{enumerate}
  \subsection*{Experimental design}
  The analysis of the EHR/adminsitrative dataset from UCM will be straightforward, where we will aim to see a demography-stratified effect of common anti-depressant prescriptions during pregnancy with the eventual ASD status of children. The relevant de-identified data will be provided by the Clinical Research Data Warehouse (CRDW) maintained by the Center for Research Informatics (CRI) at University of Chicago (funded by NIH UL1 TR000430). The CRDW has been approved by the IRB to operate as an enterprise resource to support biological research. % Data in the CRDW comes from Billing, Clinical Registries, Research Systems and Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and comprises all encounters from 1/1/2006 to date.
  % This includes over 6.8 million inpatient and outpatient encounters for at least 555,000 distinct patients resulting in greater than 268 million observations.
  We will have access to $\approx 46,950$ women with pregnancy on record with about $\approx 85,748$ children, of whom $\approx 2,500$ will have a ASD diagnosis. Of these pregnancies, we estimate about 10\% (depressive disorder prevalence), $i.e.$ $8,500$ will probably have the mothers diagnosed  with some depressive disorder, resulting in about  $200-250$ children with ASD (prevalence  $\approx 3\%$) born to women  on anti-depressants. With about 2/3 of the patient population non-white (Table~\ref{tabmotherucm}), we will be able to ascertain the proposed effect with sufficient statistical power. \textbf{Power calculations:} Based on comparing proportions for two independent samples~\citep{schlesselman1982case}; % setting p1=p0 and p2= p0*RR/(1 + p0*(RR - 1)). See Schesselman, J. (1982), Case Control Studies, p. 145,
at 95\% significance and 80\% power, yields a minimum sample size of $6,884 < 8,500$.

To test the hypothesis that affected siblings have a lower frequency of lower-functioning CYP2D6, specific CYP2D6 genotyping is required because short-read whole genome sequencing in SSC does not perform well enough in making these calls. Due to budget constraints, seven 96 well plates of samples (672) will be genotyped at an expert Pharmacogenetics Laboratory at the University of Minnesota. To enrich for low activity alleles, available SSC genotypes will be used to restrict to sib pairs of affected siblings and designated unaffected siblings who have 2 parents of Western European ancestry. To further increase power, available genotypes will be used to do CYP2D6 genotyping in sib pairs who are discordant for the CYP2D6 region inherited from both parents. Based on the laboratory determination of CYP2D6 diplotype functional characterization, the data will be analyzed to compare the frequency of low or non-functional CYP2D6 alleles in 336 affected probands to their 336 designated unaffected siblings. \textbf{Power calculations:} It is difficult to carry out a power calculation without an estimate of the effect size that we will uncover, but we will ascertain if the difference in the  frequency of CYP2D6 poor metabolizers are statistically significant between the cohorts, via a standard 2-tailed t-test for difference in means.
  
  % For the proband and matched designated sibling biosamples (n=672), we will carry out genotyping to ascertain the CYP2D6 polymorphism of affected participants, with matched siblings as control. The number of such evaluations in this pilot study is constrained by the funding limit.

  %\vspace{300pt} 
  
\subsection*{Pitfalls and alternative strategies}


% Pitfalls – the original finding is likely to be a false positive from multiple testing (unless I missed it you don’t withstand Bonferroni correction for the number of antidepressants tested much less total drugs tested) so I wouldn’t minimize that the most important thing is to replicate it and to acknowledge that as a pitfall (and consider this your first aim). Either way, you need to not say “likely to be real”

% A pitfall is limited power given the budgetary constraints (hint to the foundation to fund the full genotyping 😊).

That the protective effect arises due to mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2D6 remains to be directly validated. It is conceivable that some  unknown aspect of paroxetine mechanism-of-action is responsible,  or are statistical errors, $e.g.$ from multiple testing, or confounding effects. We will be able to eliminate the possibility of such statistical errors with our EHR analysis of the UCM data. The genomic sequencing data is designed for a direct confirmation of the CYP2D6-inhibition hypothesis, which could be proven to be not valid from our sequencing results. We would be testing $n=672$ samples as opposed to the full cohort available from SSC due to funding limitations in this pilot.

We identified other (non-psychotropic) protective drugs (Table~\ref{tabextraprelim}) of which only olmesartan is a possible CYP2D6 inhibitor (Table~\ref{tabextraprelim}). If we fail to establish the CYP2D6-inhibition hypothesis, we will attempt to formulate alternate  genetic/epigenetic explanations, that  explains the  effect observed for one or more non-SSRI drugs.

% There is also the issue of explaining prominent risk factors e.g. Sertraline, a SSRI  which is perhaps more commonly prescribed compared to Paroxetine.  As a possible explanation  of elevated risk, we note that, %begin{enumerate}
% % \item
% Sertraline potentially upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promoting neurogenesis~\citep{matrisciano2009changes,numakawa2017actions}.  Placenta does not let plasma BDNF pass to the fetus, but it lets in plasma Sertraline, which can then upregulate  BDNF expression in the fetal brain,  interfering with  brain development. Importantly,  Children with ASD (some phenotypes) are known to have higher levels of BDNF expression~\citep{kasarpalkar2014brain,yoo2014polymorphisms,meng2017elevated}. %\end{enumerate}
% We  will aim to further validate Sertraline's risk-increasing effect in the UCM cohort, although direct genomic/causal analysis is beyond the scope of the pilot, due to funding constraints.
 
\subsection*{Future directions and implications for autism diagnosis, understanding, or treatment}
%
% Patient Impact
If validated, our results will identify a protective factor and potentially reduce risk for ASD by shifting to use of paroxetine instead of other anti-depressants for those women for which antidepressants are indicated during pregnancy. The results might more broadly chart a path towards targeted drug development for reducing risk in ASD. These might include drugs that precisely down-regulate CYP2D6 via MBI, without any SSRI effect, which can then be generally prescribed  during pregnancy. Several such potential compounds are already known, $e.g.$ SCH66712 (5-fluoro-2-[4-[(2-phenyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl) methyl]-1-piperazinyl] pyrimidine)~\citep{palamanda2001mechanism} and EMTPP (1‐[(2‐ethyl‐4‐methyl‐1H‐imidazol‐5‐yl)methyl]‐4‐[4‐(trifluoromethyl)‐2‐pyridinyl]piperazine)~\citep{fujiwara2015sch}.

\subsection*{Timeline and milestones}
The project will be carried out at the University of Chicago over 2 years at a total cost of 300K, and progress will be tracked by 5 milestones% : 1) IRB approval, 2) complete UCM data analysis, 3) Year 1 report, 4) Sequencing analysis complete, and 5) Final  report
